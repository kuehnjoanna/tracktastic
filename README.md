# TRACKTASTIC

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Module 3 of the Syntax Insitut App Development
Course. The task
was to create an application using Database, MVVM pattern, Recycler View, Navigation and at least 5
Fragments. Tracktastic offers to create a counter to track whatever you like, regardles if it is
points in a game, km you run, or books you have read.
In addition, you can also use Tracktastic as a Pomodoro/Countdown Timer that is connected to each
timer, or use the timer independently, as a stoppwatch.
To make it more user friendly, you can customise the app, by changing app wallpaper or color of each
counter.
Functions like CRUD(create, update, delete), in-app and local alerts, as well as statistics or fully
functional Profile settings, are also included.

## Features

* Increment and decrement buttons to adjust the counter value.

* Display of the current counter value.

* Responsive and user-friendly UI.

* Efficient state management using Jetpack Compose.

* Preview
